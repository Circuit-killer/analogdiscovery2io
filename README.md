# Interface board for Digilent Analog Discovery 2

**Please note that this is totally untested - will update when confirmed**

A board to interface anything that uses 3.5mm mono jacks (synthesisers etc) with the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 oscilloscope/wave generator/logic analyser.

Provides access to both scope channels, wave generators, triggers plus DIO 0 to 7 via 3.5mm mono jacks. DIO 8 to 15 and V+/V-/Ground via pin headers. The negative scope channels are connected to ground.

Connects directly to the AD2 with female headers.

3mm holes in each corner for stand offs to support the board.

Note: the digital I/O on the AD2 supports overvoltage up to +-20V â€” and I presume the wave generator DAC is safe behind an opamp. However, use this at your own risk.
