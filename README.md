# Interface board for Digilent Analog Discovery 2

**Please note that this is totally untested as of 18/1/17**
**Need to investigate tolerance of digital IO as well as all other pins — probably won't like +-12V**

A board to interface anything that uses 3.5mm mono jacks (synthesisers etc) with the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 oscilloscope/wave generator/logic analyser.

Provides access to both channels, wave generators, triggers plus DIO 0 to 7 via 3.5mm mono jacks. DIO 8 to 15 and V+/V- via pin headers.

Connects directly to the AD2 with female headers — or pin headers and a 2x15 30-pin cable.

3mm holes in each corner for stand offs to support the board.

* Thonkiconn jack sockets; https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/3-5mm-jacks/
* Single row 15-pin header (cheap) -or- double row 2x15 header (expensive)
* 3x1 and 9x1 pin headers
